# [VS22] Lodelight v19.4

This project originally came from Lodelight and has now reached its End of Technical Availability (ETA). It is no longer actively maintained and will remain available for archival purposes only.

You can locate the file by viewing the following thread: https://flyff.one/threads/vs22-lodelight-v19-4.38. We encourage users to explore other active alternatives for future use and development.

We also plan to release new bases in the future, and all updates and releases can be located on https://flyff.one.

Thank you for your support!
